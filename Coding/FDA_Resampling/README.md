## Task 1. Waveforms characterization

1. Loading the datasets
2. Preprocessing steps
   - 2.1. Data wrangling on time series
   - 2.2. Data wrangling on additional features
   - 2.3. Merging time series datasets to add additional features
       - 2.3.1. Removal of testID only exists in one sensor
3. Window extraction
   - 3.1. Validating if there are partial or full missing values after the extraction
   - 3.2. Validating shape post-window extraction
   - 3.3. Scaling the post-window data: zero-alignment
   - 3.4. Merging scaled data with additional attributes of interest
   - 3.5. Balancing the specific attributes
   - 3.6. Windows visualization (balanced data)
